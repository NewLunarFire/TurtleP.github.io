			<p>My real name is Jeremy Postelnek,  and I am a Junior in college. Since high school, I've learned to program in a variety of languages: Java, C++, and Lua. Visual Basic was the first language I learned  in high school, which was what became my foundation for the passion of coding I have today. I moved onto Java the year after, and although it  was more challenging, I enjoyed every moment. Once in my final year of high school, I learned Lua through modding a game known as <i><a href="http://stabyourself.net/mari0/">Mari0</a></i>.</p><p>After many months of modding <i>Mari0</i> I then decided to fulfill my dream of making a full game which involved Lua and the <b>*awesome*</b> framework known as <a href="http://love2d.org/"><i>L&ouml;ve</i></a>. Soon after this decision, I recruited friends from the <a href="http://forum.stabyourself.net/">Stabyourself.net forums</a> who became part of the development process for each game made. I give all the credit for my passion to coding to my  high school computer science teacher, Mr. K. who helped me understand the important concepts of coding.</p><p>You can view some of my work on this site; just head over to the <a href="games.html">games</a> page.</p>
